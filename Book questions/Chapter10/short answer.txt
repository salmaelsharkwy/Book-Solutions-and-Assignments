1. What is the difference between a generator and a coroutine in Python? 
Answer: A generator produces values lazily using yield, while a coroutine can also 
consume values sent into it using send(). Coroutines are often used for event-driven 
programming and concurrency. 


2. Explain why the with statement is preferred over manual resource management. 
Answer: The with statement ensures resources (like files, sockets, or locks) are automatically cleaned up via __exit__(), even if an exception occurs, making code 
safer and cleaner. 


3. Give a real-world example where the Observer pattern might be applied. 
Answer: In a stock trading app, multiple UI components (observers) need to be 
updated whenever stock prices (subject state) change. 


4. What problem does the Factory pattern solve? 
Answer: It abstracts object creation, allowing clients to create objects without 
depending on their concrete classes. 


5. How does Dependency Injection improve testability of code? 
Answer: It allows dependencies (like services or databases) to be swapped out with 
mock objects during testing, making unit tests easier and more isolated.
