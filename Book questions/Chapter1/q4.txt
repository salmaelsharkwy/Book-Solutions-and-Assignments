PyPy vs CPython:
PyPy uses a JIT (Just-in-Time) compiler that dynamically compiles frequently executed Python code into machine code, offering significant speed improvements (often 5-10x faster) for long-running applications. It's ideal for CPU-intensive tasks like scientific computing or web servers.

Jython vs CPython:
Jython runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), allowing Python code to interact seamlessly with Java libraries. It's perfect for integrating Python into existing Java ecosystems or leveraging JVM features like garbage collection and threading.

Use cases:

PyPy: Web servers, data processing pipelines, scientific simulations

Jython: Enterprise applications needing Java libraries, Android development with Python
